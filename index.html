	<h2>Background</h2>
		<article>My parents are from Vietnam and I grew up in a Vietnamese household. It's great to speak and learn a language besides English because it's cool and it helps me speak to other Viet people that don't know English. I also eat Vietnamese food which tastes amazing.

		<h3>Lacrosse</h3>
			<article>I began playing lacrosse since freshmen year of high school and loved it ever since. The sport stood out to me because it was different than any of the other sports out there. The season starts in the spring and we have practice every weekday.<img src="images/lax.jpeg" alt="Lacrosse">
