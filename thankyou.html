			<h1>Thank You</h1>

				<p>Thank you so much for letting us come to the office last week. We enjoyed learning about your process and the tools that you use to make websites. We learned that <em>User Experience (UX)</em> is very important to the design of a website. We learned that color can cause people to have subconscious reactions, making it even more important to web design. It was interesting to hear that technology is so important that the next generation of warfare will likely be <em>cyber warfare.</em></p>
				<p>We also really enjoyed the tour of the office space. It was fascinating how relaxed everyone in the office seemed to be, despite the constant threat of a nerf battle. Other games like basketball and cornhole caught our attention and added to the relaxed atmosphere. The <b>Iron Bell</b> that gets rung after new sales was also very exciting.</p>
				<p>Thank you again for your hospitality! Say hi to Grandpa for us!</p>
				<p>Sincerely,<br>Megan, Ashley, Zac, Justin, Brendan, Thomas, Sam, Dylan, and Mrs. Collins</p>
